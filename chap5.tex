\chapter{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item CMA is a blind adaptive beamforming algorithm and LMS is a non-blind adaptive beamforming algorithm. 
\item The advantage of the CMA is the fact that it only needs the instantaneous amplitude of the array output $|y(n)|$ and therefore
no synchronization is required between d and y signals.
\end{itemize}
