The beam steering array antennas,whose radiation pattern can be adjusted in accordance with particular optimum criteria, are called smart antennas. A smart antenna is actually combination of an array of individual antenna elements along with a dedicated signal processing algorithm. The radiation patterns a smart antenna are controlled using algorithms based upon certain criteria.
